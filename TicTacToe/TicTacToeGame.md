# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Write a program to play the Tic Tac Toe Game

## The following could be considered as variants or goals while developing the game
* A simple variant is to create a two player game, where you get input from two players from the command line and then use the CheckBoardState program to determine who is the winner.
* Make the user interface friendly by showing them the current state of the board and then ask them to provide a position as input.
* A more complex variant is to create a single player game where the player can play with the computer. Computer can randomly select a position. Try implementing a Greedy Heuristic to make it much tougher.
* Another variant is to display a best of 3 or 5 choice to the user at the beginning, so that the game can be repeatedly played for 3 or 5 times as per user choice and the winner can be selected that way (2/3 or 3/5). This can be done both for the two player option and the single player option.
* A much more complex variant is to create a single player game where the player will play against the computer, only that the computer could be made more intelligent using machine learning based models for putting up a good fight.
* After achieving the AI option mentioned above, you can provide an option in the two player game where one user can ask for a hint or help from the computer and the computer can show the best possible next move.

# Do a commit for each of the following, so that your problem solving approach could be verified later

## Step 1: Create as many meaningful functions as possible
## Step 2: Write comment/pseudocode for each function
## Step 3: Write code for all the functions
## Step 4: Write several test cases with comments indicating the importance of the sample input
## Step 5: Write a main driver program and test all the cases described in step 4 to show that the code works for all cases
