# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Write a program to play the rock paper scissors game. 

### Hint: Can use random.randomint() function to generate random numbers

## The following could be considered as variants or goals while developing the game
* A simple variant is to create a two player game, where you get input from two players consecutively from the command line and then determine who is the winner.
* Since the real game is based on the element of surprise, try not to reveal the selection of the first player to the second player so that it will be a fair game
* A more complex variant is to create a single player game where the player can play with the computer. Computer can randomly select a choice.
* Another variant is to display a best of 3 or 5 choice to the user at the beginning, so that the game can be repeatedly played for 3 or 5 times as per user choice and the winner can be selected that way (2/3 or 3/5). This can be done both for the two player option and the single player option

# Do a commit for each of the following, so that your problem solving approach could be verified later

## Step 1: Create as many meaningful functions as possible
## Step 2: Write comment/pseudocode for each function
## Step 3: Write code for all the functions
## Step 4: Write several test cases with comments indicating the importance of the sample input
## Step 5: Write a main driver program and test all the cases described in step 4 to show that the code works for all cases
