# Number Guessing Game

## Write a program to generate a secret random number from 1 to n (usually 10 or 20) and ask the user to guess the number. Provide feedback to the user - whether the given number is less than or greater than the secret number. If the given number is equal to the secret number, end the game saying that you guessed correctly in "x" attempts. 

### Hint: Can use random.randomint() function to generate random numbers

## The following could be considered as variants or goals while developing the game
* Try to make it difficult for the user to guess i.e: increase the number of attempts required to guess the secret number correctly
* Try to make it easy for the user to guess i.e:decrease the number of attempts required to guess the secret number correctly
* Wrtie comments on how the above two options could be achieved, and for each, explain why you are choosing the approach that you are adopting.

# Do a commit for each of the following, so that your problem solving approach could be verified later

## Step 1: Create as many meaningful functions as possible
## Step 2: Write comment/pseudocode for each function
## Step 3: Write code for all the functions
## Step 4: Write several test cases with comments indicating the importance of the sample input
## Step 5: Write a main driver program and test all the cases described in step 4 to show that the code works for all cases
